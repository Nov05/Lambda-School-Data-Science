replied to a thread: how do we access matchbot?   
```
Quick update on Matchbot messages.
Make sure you check for this line …. “if you haven’t completed any Endorsement Reviews” in the Matchbot message you receive when you /endorsement.
:heavy_check_mark: If haven’t submitted anything for review yet, you won’t see your status, b/c nothing has been reviewed (yet)
:heavy_check_mark: As you complete your interviews, receive feedback on your materials, and as you complete your HackerRank code challenge, Matchbot will keep track of your status for you.
But if you are receiving this message and you still absolutely think a requirements should be checked off but hasn’t usually these are careers materials, DM me who reviewed your materials so that we can have them resubmit your review. Let me know if you have any questions for me!
