@here Hello!
Your CS Unit 1 Assessment can be found here: https://devskiller.com/contest/7RCDbrYuvFMz8w9257cGdX
If you need to re-attempt it, you'll need a different link. DM your TL and they'll provide it.
```

This assessment will contain 15-20 questions covering the learning objectives for your unit. The default time limit is set to 180 minutes, but the average completion time is less than 30 minutes. You should do your best to not consult external resources for this assessment but it will not be considered cheating to use notes, Training Kit, or searching online.

You will be e-mailed a pdf document of your total score, and it will only show the questions you got wrong, not the correct answer. Use this as feedback to help you identify subject areas to improve in or misunderstandings you can correct.

You will be able to take the test again if you don't pass the first time. You are allowed one reattempt for a total of two tries if needed. You will have until the end of day Thursday to pass. To retake the assessment, you will use a new test link provided to you by your TL.
