@channel Hey gang, I just wanted to update you on what's coming up with those changes to Build Week. We're still shaping it up, but we have a couple key points we're planning to hit:
* Whiteboarding techniques
* Whiteboarding practice
* HackerRank-style problem solving
* Interviewing techniques
* How to talk about code you wrote
* How to relax and work well under pressure
* How to answer questions about optimization
* Self-assessing your interviewing strengths and weaknesses
* How to code review/be code reviewed
Mornings would be a guided-project or guided teamwork along these lines.
Afternoons would be putting the techniques to practice in some form. We're working on those details of that, but it will probably involve a HackerRank type problem to work on and/or mock interviews, things of that nature.
I know a question on a lot of your minds is "How do I pass?"
You know how much I hate making last-minute changes like this, and only do it when I believe it's truly in your best interests overall. In exchange for that liberty, the criteria for passing is going to be a low bar. We're still hamming out the details, but the goal of the week is to practice interviewing techniques, so the passing criteria will be more along the lines of "Did you practice interviewing techniques, yes or no?" and less along the lines of "Solve these eight HackerRank problems in three hours! Go!"
More details tomorrow. But again, I acknowledge this change is last-minute, and I want the passing criteria to acknowledge the additional stress that change brings.
One final note about interviewing and nerves. I'm certain some of you are thinking about interview practice with some level of trepidation. If you're doing a mock interview, or you're trying to explain your code and showing it to other people, or trying to demonstrate understanding of a problem... that's putting yourself out there. And for most of you, that's nerve-wracking.
And I can empathize, because I've felt the same way, so many times. "They're going to learn that I don't understand this stuff! AAAAAaaaa! What if they find out I suck at this and I'm a fraud?! They're going to laugh at me!" I'd go crazy in my own head with this.
You might not believe it, but I used to be the absolute worst at public speaking. Just thinking about talking in front of a group of 10 people for 2 minutes would make my hands sweat. It was the same getting a code review. DID NOT WANT.
It was putting myself out there and letting people see my weaknesses.
Eventually, I came to some realizations on this front.
1. Reps cure everything. There's no way to keep talking in front of crowds about my code without eventually getting used to it and losing the fear. There's no way to keep doing anything without getting better at it.
2. Almost everyone genuinely wants to help.
3. I have the power to frame feedback as either negative or positive criticism. If someone tells me I should have bounds checked this array because I left myself open to a buffer overrun exploit, I should consider that positive criticism and factor it away for the future. Learn and move on. That mistake was a useful learning experience with significant value. What I should not do is take it as a gutpunch and think, "Ugh, I suck."
4. The Growth Mindset is incredibly liberating. When you can truly reframe every failure as a learning experience with a net gain, you become ALL POWERFUL. OK, well, maybe an exaggeration, but not much of one. If you flop, learn from it, and come back stronger. One of my favorite proverbs for the game Go is "Lose your first 50 games as quickly as possible". Attack, attack, attack, ATTACK.
5. Lastly, none of my peers actually care if my code sucks. And if they make fun of me with intent to harm, they're probably just an a--hole.
Some of these might seem obvious, but a lot of them I've only learned in the last 3 years of my life.
And I'm old. :slightly_smiling_face:
Once again, thanks for bearing with us. We'll have more detail tomorrow. :thumbsup:

@channel Good morning, everyone! :awesome:     
We have a video to watch from 8-9 today, demoing an interview with another instructor here at Lambda.     
Lecture will start at 9PT. See you then!

@channel Come on in for the first session of the brand-new interview practice build week!

@channel Hey all--working on getting the calendar updated for this week, but I wanted to give another heads-up on the schedule for today.
8-9: Interview video
9-10: Beej talking about Growth Mindset and Coding in Interviews
10-11: Sean with whiteboard practice (good stuff!)
12-3: Whiteboard practice!
3-4: Behavioral interview practice
4-5: TL standup
M-Th will follow this pattern, except the "guest speaker" will change from day to day. We have a lot of good folks from different departments coming to talk. (Also, due to scheduling, sometimes the guest speaker will be before Sean, sometimes after.)
Additionally, starting tomorrow, you'll have afternoon 1:1s with your TLs to discuss the whiteboard problem you worked on from 3-4 12-3 the day before.
Definitely keep the questions coming this week! Thanks, all!

This is the repo for this week that you can use to track progress and submit with your daily retros:
https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Build-Week-2
Here are the suggested two LeetCode problems for this afternoon:
Contains Duplicates: https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/
Add Two Numbers in Linked Lists: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
You also have the choice to choose a couple of HackerRank to work on through the afternoon. The goal is to get practice solving these kinds of problems. During our 1:1s tomorrow, your task will be to walk me through your solution as if you were teaching that concept to me (edited) 

Alex G:lambda-tl:  14:20
@channel Above are the links to a couple of recommended LeetCode problems to work on this afternoon and a repo that you can track progress and use for your retrospective PRs. We will have 1:1s Tuesday-Thursday as normal and your task will be to walk me through your LeetCode (or chosen HackerRank) problems from the day before as if you are teaching it to me. We will all meet at 3-4 PM PST for interview prep, take a short break, and meet again for our end-of-day stand-up. As always, let me know if you have any questions or don’t know what to work on

@Ethan Skamarock and all DSers.
Been talking with the DS team, and they provided some useful links.
Here's what I'd like to propose.
1. Check out the sample interview questions and problems linked below. Give the links a quick skim first to see which looks best for what you want to study up on.
2. You have the option to study that material, or work on the CS leetcodes.
3. In either case, during 1:1 you'll still be explaining what you worked on the previous day to your TL, and they'll still ask you pointed questions about how it all works.
Does that sound reasonable/like an improvement?
Still working on ways to better tune this for y'all, so feedback always welcome.

Friday Instructions from TL:
For DS on Friday Sprinkle Challenge: 
- Normal 3-hour timeslot
- Give it a shot; it is not pass or fail, just participation
- Test is experimental and still being developed
- Not standard hackerrank test, it's a separate DS test
- There will be 2 problems: You can try one or both 
(1. a puzzle, 2. production performance line something)
- At end: Give links to your Notebooks on standard sprint form. 
- You can only look at online documentation, not your own school notes.
