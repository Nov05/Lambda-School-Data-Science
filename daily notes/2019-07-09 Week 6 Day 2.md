@channel you may have seen links posted this morning, there was an *exploit* discovered for *OSx* users of zoom. not the _best_ you can do, but the _least_ you can do if you're an OSx user is

1. look for a setting "automatically turn camera on upon joining", and disable it  
2. be *extra extra extra* careful about opening zoom links. there _is_, in theory, a way for a malicious zoom link to lead to arbitrary malicious code being executed on your machine! but that'd only happen if you _saw_ a meeting being opened  
from zoom themselves:  
```
Of note, because the Zoom client user interface runs in the foreground upon launch, 
it would be readily apparent to the user that they had unintentionally joined a meeting 
and they could change their video settings or leave immediately. Also of note, we have 
no indication that this has ever happened.
```
3. *reinstall zoom over the next day or two*. completely uninstalling it is a good idea.

2. https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/07/08/response-to-video-on-concern/  

(and, again, note that this is the _least_ you can do and *not* the _best_ you can do-- some of it gets a little advanced and we don't want to stress people out)

**code challenge**

```
return ''.join(chr(ord(c)+k) for c in s)
```

Han Lee [10:55 AM]  
```
return  float(''.join(c for c in smackeroons if c in "1234567890."))
```

regex  
```
import re
return float(re.sub('[^0-9\.]','', smackeroons))

_Today in Q&A, I was asked, “what experts do you follow to stay on top of the best practices/thinking?” I promised to follow up, so here’s my answer!_
