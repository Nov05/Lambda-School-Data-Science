@channel Good morning everyone!  Today, we'll be talking about *Subroutines*.   
please make sure you take a look at the pre-class video:  
- *Subroutines* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1thob4fgBrs   
The repo for the entire week can be found here:

**Sprint Challenge Study Guide**    
``` 
1. coversions between binary, hex, decimal;   
2. bit-wise operations, logicaal operators;   
3. what are the components of a computer?   
... processor (cpu, alu), memory, registers, bus   
4. know what an interrupt is;   
5. know what the stack is, how it works, what it's used for;   
6. know how the ls-8 works, be able to implement operations...   
```
