@channel The next few days will be spent diving into a couple of additional data structures - Arrays & Hash Tables. Please get ready for today's class by watching these precourse videos:
Part 1:
- Arrays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8tSdmh_u_0
- Intro to Hash Tables: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z07XGvC9D4c
Once you've watched these, look over your assignment for the next two days: Building an array, linked list, and hash table in Python.
