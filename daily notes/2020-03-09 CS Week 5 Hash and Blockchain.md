@channel The next few days will be spent diving into a couple of additional data structures - Arrays & Hash Tables. Please get ready for today's class by watching these precourse videos:
Part 1:
- Arrays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8tSdmh_u_0
- Intro to Hash Tables: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z07XGvC9D4c
Once you've watched these, look over your assignment for the next two days: Building an array, linked list, and hash table in Python.

See you in a bit for today's guided project!

@channel Hey everyone! We’re starting with blockchain, so get ready to mine your way to success!
Today, we’ll cover:
* An introduction to Flask and some techniques we can use to rapidly learn and utilize a new framework
* Structure of blockchains & how they are implemented
* How to create a ‘proof of work’
Videos:
* Overview and Blockchain Structure: https://youtu.be/maKsJ80BhDo
* Proof of Work: https://youtu.be/CWUyDxWP6tU
```

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test":"teststring"}' localhost:5000/mine`

* You will be able to analyze the transactions in the blockchain ledger to derive the current balance for a given user
Agenda
* Morning Message and Zoom Link
* Lecture starts, warmup and hello
* Solution lecture to client mining
* Break
* Transactions, rewards for mining
* Homework Discussion - Simple Wallet App

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
1. What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
2. What is the worst case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
3. Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
4. Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

Each Block has an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions, a proof (more on that later), and the hash of the previous Block.  
Proof of Work, easy to verify, hard to compute.
